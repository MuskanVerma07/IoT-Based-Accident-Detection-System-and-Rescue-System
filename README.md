# IoT-Based Accident Detection and Rescue System

## Overview
The IoT-Based Accident Detection and Rescue System** is designed to enhance road safety by detecting vehicle accidents in real-time and immediately notifying emergency services and relevant contacts. This system leverages IoT technology to minimize response time, potentially saving lives.

## Features
- Real-Time Accident Detection: Uses sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes to detect collisions.
- GPS Tracking: Captures the exact location of the accident.
- Automatic Alert System: Sends an alert to emergency contacts and authorities via SMS or email.
- Cloud Integration: Stores accident data for further analysis.
- User Interface: Provides an interactive dashboard for monitoring accident reports.

## Technologies Used
- Hardware: Arduino/Raspberry Pi, GPS Module, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, GSM Module
- Software: Python, C++, Embedded C
- Cloud Services: Firebase/AWS IoT
- Communication Protocols: MQTT, HTTP

## System Architecture
1. Sensor Module: Detects impact and gathers data from accelerometer and gyroscope.
2. Microcontroller Unit (MCU): Processes sensor data and determines accident occurrence.
3. Communication Module: Sends location and alert messages via GSM or internet services.
4. Cloud Storage & Processing: Stores incident data and provides analytics.
5. Dashboard/UI: Displays real-time alerts and reports.

## Installation & Setup
### Hardware Setup
1. Connect the accelerometer and gyroscope to the microcontroller.
2. Integrate the GPS module for location tracking.
3. Connect the GSM module for SMS alerts.
4. Power the system with a battery or external power source.

### Software Setup
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests paho-mqtt firebase-admin
   ```
2. Deploy the backend server (if applicable) and configure cloud services.
3. Upload the microcontroller code to Arduino/Raspberry Pi.

## Usage
1. Power on the system and ensure proper sensor calibration.
2. Monitor the data via the dashboard or log files.
3. In case of an accident, verify the alert and take necessary action.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Mobile app development for better user interaction.
- AI-based predictive analytics for accident prevention.
